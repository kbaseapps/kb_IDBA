    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for the <a href="https://github.com/loneknightpy/idba" target="_blank">IDBA</a> short read assembler.</p>

    <p>IDBA-UD is an iterative graph-based assembler for single-cell and standard metagenomic short reads. IDBA-UD is an extension of IDBA algorithm and is good for data of highly uneven sequencing depth. In its assembly process, IDBA-UD iterates from a small <i>k</i> to a large <i>k</i>. In each iteration, short and low-depth contigs are removed using depth-relative cutoff thresholds, from low to high, to reduce the errors in low-depth and high-depth regions. This iterative approach compensates for the information loss with de Bruijn graphs constructed using a single kmer length. The reads are assembled locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions. For this reason, IDBA-UD is considered one of the more accurate microbial assemblers. IDBA-UD takes paired-end reads as input and generates an Assembly object as output.</p>

    <p>IDBA version: 1.1.3.</p>
